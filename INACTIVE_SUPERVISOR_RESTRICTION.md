# Inactive Supervisor Restriction Feature

## Overview
Implemented restrictions to prevent students from sending supervision requests to inactive supervisors. This ensures that only active supervisors receive new project requests and appear in supervisor selection lists.

## Problem Statement
Previously, students could send supervision requests to any supervisor regardless of their active status. This could lead to:
- Requests sent to supervisors who are not available
- Confusion when supervisors don't respond due to inactive status
- Poor user experience for students

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Student Dashboard - Supervisor Selection Filter
**Location**: `routes/web.php` (Student Dashboard Route)

**Before**:
```php
$supervisors = Supervisor::with("user")->get()->map(function ($s) {
```

**After**:
```php
$supervisors = Supervisor::with("user")
    ->whereHas('user', function($query) {
        $query->where('is_active', true);
    })
    ->get()->map(function ($s) {
```

**Impact**: Only active supervisors appear in the project creation form dropdown.

### 2. Supervisor List Page Filter
**Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/SupervisorRequestController.php` - `indexForStudent()` method

**Before**:
```php
$supervisors = User::where('role', 'supervisor')->get();
```

**After**:
```php
$supervisors = User::where('role', 'supervisor')
              ->where('is_active', true)
              ->get();
```

**Impact**: Only active supervisors appear in the dedicated supervisor selection page.

### 3. Request Validation
**Location**: `app/Http/Controllers/SupervisorRequestController.php` - `sendRequest()` method

**Added Validation**:
```php
// التحقق من أن المشرف نشط
$supervisorUser = $supervisor->user;
if (!$supervisorUser || !$supervisorUser->is_active) {
    return back()->withErrors(['supervisor' => 'This supervisor is currently inactive and cannot accept new requests.']);
}
```

**Impact**: Even if someone tries to send a request directly (bypassing UI), the system validates supervisor status.

## Security Layers

### Layer 1: UI Filtering
- **Frontend Prevention**: Inactive supervisors don't appear in selection lists
- **User Experience**: Students only see available supervisors
- **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary data loading

### Layer 2: Backend Validation
- **Server-Side Check**: Validates supervisor status before creating requests
- **Error Handling**: Clear error message for inactive supervisors
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid requests in database

### Layer 3: Database Consistency
- **Active Status Field**: `is_active` boolean column in users table
- **Default Value**: New supervisors are active by default
- **Supervisor Control**: Supervisors can toggle their own status

## User Experience Improvements

### For Students:
- ✅ **Clear Selection**: Only see available supervisors
- ✅ **No Confusion**: Won't send requests to unavailable supervisors
- ✅ **Better Response**: Higher chance of getting responses
- ✅ **Error Feedback**: Clear message if somehow trying to contact inactive supervisor

### For Supervisors:
- ✅ **Workload Control**: Can set themselves inactive when busy
- ✅ **No Unwanted Requests**: Won't receive requests when inactive
- ✅ **Easy Toggle**: Simple active/inactive status control
- ✅ **Immediate Effect**: Status change takes effect immediately

### For System:
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Prevents invalid supervision requests
- ✅ **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary data processing
- ✅ **Consistency**: Same filtering logic across all entry points

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema:
- **Column**: `users.is_active` (boolean)
- **Default**: `true` (active by default)
- **Nullable**: No (required field)
- **Index**: Consider adding index for performance if needed

### Query Optimization:
```php
// Efficient query with relationship filtering
$supervisors = Supervisor::with("user")
    ->whereHas('user', function($query) {
        $query->where('is_active', true);
    })
    ->get();
```

### Error Messages:
- **English**: "This supervisor is currently inactive and cannot accept new requests."
- **User-Friendly**: Clear explanation of why request failed
- **Actionable**: Students understand they need to choose different supervisor

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases:
1. **Active Supervisor Selection**:
   - ✅ Active supervisors appear in dropdown
   - ✅ Students can send requests to active supervisors
   - ✅ Requests are created successfully

2. **Inactive Supervisor Filtering**:
   - ✅ Inactive supervisors don't appear in dropdown
   - ✅ Inactive supervisors don't appear in supervisor list page
   - ✅ Direct requests to inactive supervisors are blocked

3. **Status Toggle Testing**:
   - ✅ Supervisor sets status to inactive → disappears from lists
   - ✅ Supervisor sets status to active → appears in lists again
   - ✅ Existing requests remain unaffected by status changes

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - ✅ Supervisor becomes inactive after student starts form → validation catches it
   - ✅ Malicious direct POST requests → backend validation prevents them
   - ✅ Database corruption scenarios → proper error handling

## Files Modified

### Controllers:
1. **`app/Http/Controllers/SupervisorRequestController.php`**:
   - `indexForStudent()`: Added `is_active` filter
   - `sendRequest()`: Added supervisor status validation

### Routes:
2. **`routes/web.php`**:
   - Student dashboard route: Added `whereHas` filter for active supervisors

### Views:
No view files were modified as the filtering happens at the data level.

## Performance Considerations

### Query Performance:
- **Indexed Queries**: Consider adding index on `users.is_active` if needed
- **Relationship Loading**: Using `whereHas` for efficient filtering
- **Caching**: Consider caching active supervisor list if frequently accessed

### Memory Usage:
- **Reduced Data**: Only loading active supervisors reduces memory usage
- **Efficient Mapping**: Same mapping logic, just fewer records

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Notification System**: Notify students when their supervisor becomes inactive
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle existing requests when supervisor becomes inactive
3. **Batch Operations**: Admin ability to bulk activate/deactivate supervisors
4. **Activity Tracking**: Log when supervisors change their status

### Advanced Features:
1. **Temporary Inactive**: Set inactive status with automatic reactivation date
2. **Partial Availability**: Different availability levels (full, limited, unavailable)
3. **Workload Management**: Automatic inactive when reaching request limit
4. **Department Filtering**: Show only supervisors from student's department

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Metrics to Track:
- **Active Supervisor Count**: Monitor how many supervisors are active
- **Request Success Rate**: Measure improvement in response rates
- **Status Change Frequency**: Track how often supervisors toggle status
- **Student Experience**: Monitor if students find supervisors more easily

### Alerts:
- **Low Active Supervisors**: Alert when too few supervisors are active
- **High Inactive Rate**: Monitor if too many supervisors go inactive
- **Request Failures**: Track blocked requests to inactive supervisors

## Conclusion

This feature provides a comprehensive solution for managing supervisor availability while maintaining data integrity and improving user experience. The multi-layer approach ensures that inactive supervisors are properly filtered at all entry points, preventing confusion and improving the overall supervision request process.

The implementation is backward-compatible and doesn't affect existing supervision relationships, only preventing new requests to inactive supervisors.
